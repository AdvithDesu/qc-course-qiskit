## qc-course-qiskit

Getting started is simple, make sure you have python on your system and run the following command. It would be preferable to create a conda environment and install qiskit inside that, however this step is optional.

The minimum recommended version of python is 3.9, anything above that should work fine.

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
```

Here we need `qiskit` for the main functionalities and [`qiskit-aer`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer) for the simulators. We will be running the simulators on your own systems. You can then install jupyter notebook and run

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You may create your own notebooks or use the existing notebooks we have created to follow along. Before you start our tutorials we recommend watching IBM's own qiskit tutorials on youtube. Click below to carry on
